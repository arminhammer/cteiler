# blaster will be armin's take on how the program should be implemented.

# Each instance of the application will be both a client and a server.

# Instead a simple host that has all of the files to be shared. The application
# will allow the user to send specific files to a specific user.

# This means at least on the outset, we have to be able to find and store the location of the recipients. 

# One user, will be able to send any of the other users a file. The recipient will approve the transfer. 

# The workflow will be the following:

# 1) two users; Bill, Shaq start the application.
# 2) Bill has a document, shaq has a song. Bill wants the song, shaq wants the document.
# 3) To get the the song, Bill finds shaq on his user list, and drops the file on his user name.

#I don't like this
